# Organization Rules

##### All new repositories must adhere to a strict naming convention, ensuring that each repository name clearly reflects its purpose and contents. Every repository MUST include a README file that clearly explains the project's objectives, features, and usage instructions. This ensures that anyone interacting with the repository can quickly understand its use and functionality.

##### Branch names must also be clear and descriptive, reflecting the work being done. When making commits, it is important that each commit message is detailed and explains precisely what changes have been made. Do not overwrite old commits. Each commit should provide a clear history of the project's development, aiding in tracking changes and understanding the project's evolution.

##### Make sure we maintain a clean, simple, and organized repository and organization structure. No nonsense or unnecessary clutter will be tolerated. Every repository should be straightforward and to the point, making it easy for contributors and users to navigate and understand. Following these guidelines is essential to ensure consistency, clarity, and efficiency in our development process.
